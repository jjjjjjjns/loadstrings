Please do not link-shrink my scripts, thanks.

Important notice: Eventually a networking feature called RejectCharacterDeletions will stop this script from working.

# This script only works with the R15 body type.
# The script execution can be detected by games serversided.
# If the script isn't working well you might need to set heigher values depanding on how long does it take to your character to fully load once it spawns. (I recommend to use 1.1 multipliers)

Avatar scale settings to become small as possible:
(https://www.roblox.com/my/avatar)

Body Type: 0%
Height: 90%
Width: 70%
Head: 95%
Proportions: 0%

--//Settings
getfenv().ToRemove = {
    {"BodyTypeScale", 0.5 * 1.0},
    {"BodyWidthScale", 1 * 1.0},
    {"BodyDepthScale", 1 * 1.0}
}

getfenv().AlwaysOn = true --\\ Enabling this can make you way smaller after character reset in most games.

--//Loadstring
loadstring(game:HttpGet('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NoclippyT/Scripts/main/%23Misc/TinyR15/Main.lua'))()
